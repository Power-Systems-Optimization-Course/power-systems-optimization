    "The 'core' model and data we will use are provided in [Notebooks/extra_labs/Lab1.jl](https://github.com/Power-Systems-Optimization-Course/power-systems-optimization/blob/master/Notebooks/extra_labs/Lab1.jl), [Notebooks/extra_labs/Lab1_code.jl](https://github.com/Power-Systems-Optimization-Course/power-systems-optimization/blob/master/Notebooks/extra_labs/Lab1_code.jl) and the [complex_expansion_data](https://github.com/Power-Systems-Optimization-Course/power-systems-optimization/tree/master/Notebooks/complex_expansion_data) folder. This core model includes economic dispatch decisions with ramp constraints for thermal generators and storage constraints (**but no thermal unit commitment constraints/decisions**). It uses a simplified capacitated transport flow constraint to represent inter-regional electricity transmission between three regions (rather than DC OPF constraints), with data representing the Electricity Reliability Corporation of Texas (ERCOT) region."

(2018), \"[Impact of model resolution on scenario outcomes for electricity sector system expansion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.08.015)\" Energy 163). \n",
    "\n",
    "This method creates clusters of representative periods by trying to minimize variation between time series for wind, solar, and demand in each of the within-cluster periods (days or weeks). It also always includes the period containing the peak demand hour, if this period was not already selected as a cluster centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a full year of hourly operations, hours within each time period are weighted by a multiplier equal to the total number of periods (days or weeks) within the cluster represented by each representative period. In the objective function of the model, variable costs incurred in each hour are thus multiplied by this hourly weight to represent the cost of a full year of operation, as shown in the following two expressions, which make up the variable cost related part of the model objective function: "
