    "## Optimal Power Flow\n",
    "**Power Systems Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "by Michael R. Davidson, Jesse D. Jenkins and Sambuddha Chakrabarti (last updated: October 24, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in electric power systems&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand at a number of connected locations from a given set of generators subject to various technical and transmission network flow limit constraints. This will be our first treatment of a *network*, which is critical to all power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first introduce a model of transmission flows that assumes we can control the flow along each path, in what is called a \"**transport model**.\" This is a straightforward extension to [Economic Dispatch](04-Economic-Dispatch.ipynb) (ED), where we have multiple supply and demand balance constraints at each location or \"node\" in the network, and a new set of flow constraints between nodes. This is also similar to other common optimization problems such as fleet routing of shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem known as \"**DC-OPF**\", where we begin to incorporate some of the physics involved in how electricity flows along transmission lines. With this formulation, we recognize that given \"injections\" (i.e., generation) and \"withdrawals\" (i.e., demand) of power at each node in the network, flows along lines are not independently controllable. Instead, electrical power flows across transmission lines in relation to their physical properties, namely power flows across parallel circuits or paths in inverse proportion to the [electrical impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) of the lines. This can (very frequently) result in hitting flow constraints before we would if could control power flows across all lines as in the transport problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not explore the full functionality of DC-OPF, which can include inter-temporal constraints, additional generation constraints (e.g., on voltage), security constraints to ensure stability in the case of contingencies, and network losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full \"AC optimal power flow\" models are also beyond the scope of this notebook, as the full set of physics associated with the interactions of AC flows introduces non-convexities that make this problem much harder to solve. Due to the non-convex nature of the AC power flow problem, simplified formulations that linearize and approximate these complex constraints are frequently employed in power systems operations, including by electricity system operators, which use a linearized \"security-constrained\" optimal power flow (which ensures power flows would remain simulatenously feasible across a range of possible contingencies) to clear real-time electricity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start off with some simple systems, whose solutions can be worked out manually without resorting to any mathematical optimization model and software. But, eventually we will be solving larger system, thereby emphasizing the importance of such software and mathematical models."

    "## Introduction to OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a power system optimal scheduling problem which captures the physics of electricity flows across electricity networks, adding a layer of complexity and more realism to the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. OPF usually attempts to capture the entire network topology by representing the transmission line interconnections between different nodes (also known as buses, or locations where generators or demand inject or withdraw power into/from the network) including various electrical parameters, such as resistance, series reactance, shunt admittance, etc. The full alternating current or \"AC\" OPF is a non-convex problem and turns out to be an extremely hard problem to solve (usually NP-hard). Hence, system operators and power marketers usually go about solving a linearized version of it, called the \"DC-OPF.\" The DC-OPF approximation works satisfactorily for bulk power transmission networks as long as such networks are not operated at the brink of instability or under heavily loaded conditions."

    "\n",
    "The above model is not physically correct as we cannot arbitrarily route power through lines. We will now introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem that incorporates this limitation and is tractable and reasonably accurate. This is commonly called the \"DC\" optimal power flow problem, but in reality (as we'll see below), it is a linearization that still relates to the physics of AC power flows, it just simplifies (and ignores) certain non-convexities to produce a tractable linear programming problem that remains a valid approximation under certain circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"DC\" or linear approximation of the AC optimal power flow problem, power flows along a line from bus $i$ to bus $j$ are driven by voltage [phase angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor) differences, denoted by $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$:\n",

    "FLOW_{ij} = BaseMVA \\times B_{ij} (\\theta_i-\\theta_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $FLOW_{ij}$ is the flow across the line from node $i$ to node $j$ (in MW), $BaseMVA$ is the base power for the network (in MVA), $B_{ij}$ is the [susceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susceptance) for the line connecting buses $i$ and $j$ (in per unit terms) and $(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)$ is the difference in voltage angles between buses (in radians).\n",
    "\n",
    "Susceptance is the imaginary part of the [admittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance) of a line, where [admittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance) is a complex number that describes how easy it is for AC current to flow across a given conductor. Power flows in parallel circuits in an AC network in proportion to their admittance (or inverse proportion to [impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance), which describes how hard it is a measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied).\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage [phase](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/alternating-current/chpt-1/ac-phase/) angles describe the displacement of the AC voltage waveform at each node, relative to a reference or \"slack\" bus. A difference in voltage angles between buses $i$ and $j$ indicates that the peaks and troughs in the sinusoidal voltage waveform at bus $i$ are shifted in time relative to the voltage waveform at bus $j$, as in the image below.\n",

    "\n",
    "In AC circuits, power flows from nodes with higher voltage angle to buses with lower voltage angle, just as power flows from higher voltage magnitude to lower voltage magnitude in DC circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "What causes the shift in voltage phase angle? An AC current flowing across a conductor encountering either [inductive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Inductive_reactance) (which relates to the magnetizing current, or the energy required to continually induce or establish magnetic fields around a conductor as AC current polarity flips each cycle) or [capacitive reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Capacitive_reactance) (which relates to the charging current, or the energy required to sustain capacitive charges between two conductors separated by an insulator) will experience a shift in the voltage waveform, relative to the current wave form. Inductive reactance causes the voltage waveform to shift forward relative to the current, while capacitive reactive cases the voltage to shift backwards relative to the current. In overhead transmission lines, the primary source of voltage phase angle shifts is the inductance of the transmission lines themselves (although capacitance is relevant for underground lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "(For (a bit) more on the physics of power flow on AC transmissio lines, you can review [this tutorial from the PJM Interconnection](https://learn.pjm.com/~/media/training/nerc-certifications/gen-exam-materials/bet/20160104-basics-of-elec-power-flow-on-ac.ashx))\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this approximation is known as the \"DC OPF\" is because we ignore [reactive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power#Reactive_power_flows) and focus only on flows of real power as in a DC network. But you can see why \"DC\" OPF is actually a misnomer: we're still dealing with AC voltages and susceptance terms here, we're just linearizing the problem through some simplifying assumptions. In particular, the three basic assumptions used to derive a linearized or \"DC\" OPF approximation from the underlying AC OPF problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The resistance for each branch is negligible relative to the reactance, and can therefore be approximated as ~0.\n",
    "2. The voltage magnitude at each bus is constant and equal to the base voltage (e.g. equal to 1 p.u).\n",
    "3. The voltage angle difference $(\\theta_j-\\theta_i)$ across any branch from bus $i$ to $j$ is sufficiently small such that $cos(\\theta_i-\\theta_j) \\approx 1$ and $sin(\\theta_i-\\theta_j) \\approx (\\theta_i-\\theta_j)$. Note that $\\theta_i,\\theta_j$ are measured in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, under normal operating conditions, these conditions hold for electricity transmission networks (although note they are not generally acceptable simplifying assumptions for lower voltage distribution networks). "
