    "## Optimal Power Flow\n",
    "**Power Systems Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "by Michael R. Davidson and Jesse D. Jenkins (last updated: September 27, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introductory glimpse of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand at a number of connected locations from a given set of generators subject to various technical and flow limit constraints. This will be our first treatment of a **network**, which is critical to all power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first introduce a model of transmission flows that assumes we can control the flow along each path, in what is called a \"transport model\". This is a straightforward extension to Economic Dispatch (ED), where we have multiple supply and demand balance constraints, and a new set of flow constraints. This is also similar to other common optimization problems such as fleet routing of shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem known as \"DC-OPF\", where we begin to incorporate some of the physics involved in how electricity flows along transmission lines. With this, we recognize that given \"injections\" (i.e., generation) and withdrawals (i.e., demand) of power, flows along lines are not independently controllable. This can (very frequently) result in hitting flow constraints before we would if could control them as in the transport problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model does not explore the full functionality of DC-OPF, which can include inter-temporal constraints, additional generation constraints (e.g., on voltage), security constraints to ensure stability in the case of contingencies, and network losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full \"AC optimal power flow\" models are also beyond the scope of this notebook, as the full set of physics associated with the interactions of AC flows introduces non-linearities that are much harder to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start off with some simple systems, whose solutions can be worked out manually without resorting to any mathematical optimization model and software. But, eventually we will be solving larger system, thereby emphasizing the importance of such software and mathematical models."

    "## Introduction to OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a power system optimal scheduling problem which fully captures the physics of electricity flows, which adds a leyr of complexity, as well gives a more realistic version of the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. It usually attempts to capture the entire network topology by representing the interconnections between the different nodes through transmission lines and also representing the electrical parameters, like the resistance, series reactance, shunt admittance etc. of the lines. however, the full-blown \"AC\" OPF turns out to be an extremely hard problem to solve (usually NP-hard). Hence, system operators and power marketers usually go about solving a linearized version of it, called the DC-OPF. The DC-OPF approximation works satisfactorily for bulk power transmission networks as long as such networks are not operated at the brink of instability or, under very heavily heavily loaded conditions.\n"
