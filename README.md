These course materials are jointly developed by [Michael Davidson](http://mdavidson.org/) and [Jesse Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) for introducing constrained optimization models applied to power systems. In **Fall 2020**, these materials will be used for:
- [MAE / ENE 539](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1212&courseid=008273) Optimization Methods for Energy Systems Engineering (Advanced Topics in Combustion I) [Princeton]
- MAE 207 Electric Power Systems Modeling (Topics in Engineering Science) [UC San Diego]

### Description

This course will teach students constrained optimization problems and associated solution methods, how to implement and apply linear and mixed integer linear programs to solve such problems using [Julia](https://julialang.org/)/[JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/dev/), and the practical application of such techniques in energy systems engineering.

The course will first introduce students to the theory and mathematics of constrained optimization problems and provide a brief introduction to linear programming, including problem formation and solution algorithms.

Next, to build hands-on experience with optimization methods for energy systems engineering, the course will introduce students to several canonical problems in electric power systems planning and operations, including: economic dispatch, unit commitment, optimal network power flow, and capacity planning.

Finally, several datasets of realistic power systems are provided which students will use in conjunction with building a model for a course project that answers a specific power systems question.
